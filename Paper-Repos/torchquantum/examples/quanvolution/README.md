In this tutorial, we use `tq.QuantumDevice`, `tq.GeneralEncoder`, `tq.RandomLayer`, `tq.MeasureAll`, `tq.PauliZ` class from TrochQuantum.

You can learn how to build, train and evaluate a quanvolutional filter using TorchQuantum in this tutorial.

## Introduction to Quanvolutional Neural Network.
### Convolutional Neural Network
Convolutional neural network is a classic neural network genre, mostly applied to anylize visual images. They are known for their convolutional layers that perform convolution. Typically the convolution operation is the Frobenius inner product of the convolution filter with the input image followed by an activation function. The convolution filter slides along the input image and generates a feature map. We can use the feature map for classification.

### Quantum convolution
One can extend the same idea also to the context of quantum variational circuits. Replace the classical convolution filters with variational quantum circuits and we get quanvolutional neural networks with quanvolutional filters. The quanvolutional filters perform more complex operations in a higher dimension Hilbert space than Frobenius inner product. Therefore, quanvolutional filters have more potential than traditional convolution filters.
