# Lab 1: Basic operations

- Introduction to Qiskit circuit elements and operations.
- Oracles and the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm

# Lab 2: Introduction to Variational Algorithms

In this Lab, you will learn about
- variational quantum algorithms, in particular Variational Quantum Eigensolvers
- how to create and work with parameterized circuits and quadratic programs in Qiskit
- how to solve optimization problems using QAOA 

# Lab 3: Quantum Kernels and Support Vector Machines

In this lab, you will learn how to implement quantum feature maps, quantum kernels and quantum support vector classification in Qiskit. Quantum kernels are built to be used directly by scikit-learn SVC.

# Lab 4: Training Parameterized Quantum Circuits

In this lab session we will have a closer look on how to train circuit-based models. At the end of this session you should know
- how to build variational quantum classifiers
- how to use different training techniques, especially gradient-based
- what restrictions the variational-based models have and how we might overcome them


# Lab 5: Introduction to Hardware Efficient Ansatze for Quantum Machine Learning

In this lab, you will see how noise affects a typical parameterized quantum circuit used in machine learning using quantum process tomography.
